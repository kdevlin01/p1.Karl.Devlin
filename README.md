# Human Computer Interaction Prject 1
- This is a repo for Project 1 of CS 3366-002

Project requirements:
===

**To get a C, you need to:**
- [x] Find an elevator in the apartment/hotel/airport. Only one example for each student.
- [x] Take photos of the control interface
- [x] Show a gif image of the control interface in operation.
- [x] Find the issues with the current design.
- [ ] Explain why it is good/bad.

**To get a B, you need to:**
- [ ] Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
- [ ] Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
- [ ] How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?
- [ ] How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
- [ ] What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
- [ ] Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.
- [ ] Here is an example of Low-Fidelity Prototype sketching out the design (for a different purpose).


**To get a A, you need to:**
- [ ] Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
- [ ] Design and implement interactive features
- [ ] Design and implement user feedback
- [ ] You use Processing for this project.

**You can get extra credits if:**
- [ ] Your design supports people with disabilities
- [ ] You provide extra useful information on the display interface.
- [ ] Your imagination ...

**Issues with current Design**
* Labeling is hard to read.
  * Bad Design. The font is inconsistent and hard to read from any convenient distance.   
* Emergency phone button label is confusing.
  * Bad design. "HELP", "PHONE", "PUSH TO CALL" are all reffering to the same button, the redundancy of these labels is confusing, and would impede the users cognitive abilities in time of crisis.
* It is hard to differentiate betweeen rear and front buttons.
  * Bad design. A more understandable design than a simple "#R" label would be better. For instance: a color-code system or tabular design.
* Buttons are organized well and are all accounted for.
  * Good design. It is easy to identify buttons and none are missing.
* Design is uniform and viually appealing.
  * Good design. The design is easy to look at and does not distract the user from properly using the elevator.
